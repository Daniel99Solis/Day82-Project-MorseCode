# -------------------- Morse Code ------------------------------ #
# 1. The first thing to do was to investigate what Morse Code is, because
# I had no idea how the code works, the next pages help me to understand the structure
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code
# https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html
# https://future-seafarer.com/morse-code/#:~:text=SPACE%20BETWEEN%20DOT%20OR%20DASH,Space%20Equal%20To%20Seven%20Dots.

# 2. Now the next step is to decide how to translate a user's input to a
# morse code. I came up with the idea of using an API to avoid writing down
# all the symbols for each letter, number into the morse code.

# So I am going to use the next API to get the morse code
